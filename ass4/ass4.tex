\section {Question 5 - AdaBoost vs. SVM}

Dataset URL: \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Skin+Segmentation}
\\\\
Using the same dataset from the last assignment (Skin Segmentation),
I tested AdaBoost on varying iterations ranging from 1 to 200.
I used linear threshold decision stumps as weak classifiers.
\\\\
The success rate was high on all iteration runs,
but showed notable improvement when running more than 100 iterations.
\\\\\
Since the dataset is pretty much seperable, SVM also showed a good success rate.
However, it was painfully slower than AdaBoost:
While adaboost took less then a minute on each run (even when using 200 iterations),
SVM took more than 10 minutes!
\\\\
I suspect the big difference in time complexity
is due to very simple (and fast) weak classifiers (decision stumps) in use.
In comparison, SVM has much more computations to perform (even with the linear kernel).
