    <h1>Awesome Email App</h1>

    <h2>Functionality</h2>

    <h3>Tester Percpective</h3>
    <h4>welcome.html</h4>
    <p>
      Please surf to <a href="http://54.76.197.180:3008/welcome.html"><code>http://54.76.197.180:3008/welcome.html</code></a> and register.
      Upon registering you'll be redirected to <code>/mail.html</code>.
      You can now also login using the username and password submitted on registration.
    </p>
    <h4>mail.html</h4>
    <p>
      Usage is pretty much straighforward, and works as expected.
      Mail addresses are used without the <code>@bitsplease.com</code> postfix.
      Just use the username without it when addressing:
      i.e. send emails to <code>username</code> and not to <code>username@bitsplease.com</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also send yourself an email (or to another user, logged in another computer),
      and you'll see the email received in the inbox pretty instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're also welcome to disconnect your network connection and send mail.
      It will be actually sent when you reconnect.
    </p>

    <h3>Developer Percpective</h3>

    <h4>Server-side</h4>
    <h5>Custom <code>http</code> module</h5>
    <p>
      The server is using a custom <code>http</code> module,
      which was originally used in the previous exercise.
      It was modified and extended to suit this exercise's needs.
    </p>
    <h5>MongoDB Schema Structure</h5>
    <p>
      Schemas used are <code>user</code> and <code>mail</code>.
      Each user document has the expected fields of username, password, first/last name, age, etc.,
      where the email address is just the <code>username</code> field of the <code>user</code> schema.
      Mail also has its expected fields of to/from (user document reference),
      subject, body, and date.
    </p>
    <h5>Data Types</h5>
    <p>Information sent from/to the server uses only JSON objects
      (except for the HTML responses, of course).</p>

    <h4>Client-side</h4>
    <h5>Backbone Model Structure</h5>
    <p>
      The only model in use is <code>Email</code>,
      which stores a single mail data.

      An <code>EmailList</code> collection was implemented to store
      a single user's collection of (inbox) mails.
    </p>
    <h5>Socket.IO</h5>
    <p>
      A Websocket connection is opened against the server upon a succesful login.
      In addition, the server stores a user-id hashmap,
      which is also used to identify Socket.IO connections,
      and notify users upon receiving new mail.
    </p>
    <h5>Custom Serialization Function</h5>
    <p>
      A custom <code>serializeObject()</code> function was implemented in
      <code>public/js/default.js</code>
      in order to serialize complex objects,
      so they could be sent properly to the server using JSON requests.
    </p>
    <h5>Manifest (AppCache) File</h5>
    <p>
      A manifest file is used to cache all <code>.html</code> pages,
      in addition to all static files in use.

    <h2>Course Remarks</h2>
    <p>
      The course was very useful for us, and we really learned a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some good stuff:
      <ol>
        <li>Refael and Avi were really helpful (and friendly!).</li>
        <li>Assignment instructions were very thorough and understandable. The links in the assignment were also nice.</li>
        <li>It was very nice to submit using GitHub and receive remarks using GitHub Issues.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Some stuff for improvement <code>:)</code>
      <ol>
        <li>The GitHub Issues remarks could probably be a bit more detailed.
          Some we couldn't understand because no example was given.
          Perhaps links to specific code lines should be used when opening issues
          (it's really easy to do with GitHub Issues).</li>
        <li>There was no exam-mock to prepare for the exam!</li>
      </ol>
