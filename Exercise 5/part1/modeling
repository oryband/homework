We split our database into 3 collections:
  * Participant - holds information of a specific participant in the show.
  * Show - holds information of a specific show that took place on a specific day.
  * Song - holds information of a specific song that one of the participants might sing.

Participant is a different collection as multiple Shows might list the same participants, 
so in order to not duplicate the information they are separate collections.
Songs are represented in an array of objects per participant, which corresponds to the list
of chosen songs by the participant. Also, for each participant in a show (part of the array in Show)
there is an object for the song he choose for that specific show.

// TODO: fix after there's an answer for the issue with query 7
/*Song is a different collection as it is associated with a list of chosen songs per Participant,*/
/*but also as songs a participant has chosen for a specific Show. Otherwise, we would have to copy*/
/*the song from the participant song list to a specific Show chosen songs.*/

Every Participant has its private information and favorite pet and food, along with the singingDay
it will perform at, which is a number - either 4 for Wednesday or 7 for Saturday.
We also save a list of references to Song's that this participant chose for the competition.

For each show that occurred, there is a Show document representing it, that contains an array of participants
that performed on that show. Each such array element has an 'sms' field, which is the amount of SMSes that 
the participant received for his performance on that show, a reference to the song ('song' field) he performed 
and a reference to the participant object.
