          <p>Welcome to my personal page!</p>
          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student in Ben Gurion University, graduating in 2014. 
            I like watching movies and TV shows, computers (mainly programming and games) 
            and sports - football and american football.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite bands are Dream Theater, Paramore, Linkin Park and Disturbed 
            in no particular order. I really like music, especially while driving.
