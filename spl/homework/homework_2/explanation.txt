This is dangerous since:

1. The area `pPointer` is pointing towards is deallocated once
SomeFunction() is done being executed. This is because nNumber is a local
variable, meaning it's allocated on the stack, and is deleted when leaving
its scope.

2. Also, the memory isn't freed after use. Safe-delete is recommended since
the pointer is shared in two functions.

A better idea would be:

1. Allocate memory for int* outside SomeFunction() - Inside main().
2. Have SomeFunction() receieve the initialized int* pointer, and update its value.
4. Don't forget to safe-delete after printing.
